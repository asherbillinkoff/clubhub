## Project Description

React E-commerce platform for buying golf clubs and apparel. This repository contains the client code.

What does the platform do?
- Allows a customer to purchase golf clubs for sale with all sorts of specifications.
- The clubs are displayed in a paginated listing with pictured cards of each product that include a some information.
- Products can be filtered by price, club type, brand and handedness.
- Users can create an account and login if they would like to add clubs to their cart or wishlist. Must be registered to complete purchase.
- Users can select specific products to see a detailed description of all the specifications for that item.

Why did I use this specific stack?
- React allows for really quick responsiveness which gives the user the feeling that they are interacting with a snappy web app.
- Bootstrap components gave the site a very clean and modern look. Also very convenient for formatting layouts directly within the component.
- Express is a lightweight and minimalistic framework, which makes it easy to learn, use and customize.
- It also provides a lot of flexibility in terms of how you want to structure your application and how you want to handle different HTTP requests.

Features for next version:
- Admin screen for sellers to upload new products online and manage their store.
- Product reviews and ratings for customers to relay product feedback.
